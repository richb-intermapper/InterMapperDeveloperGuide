        <p>InterMapper Reports Server is a PostgreSQL database that retrieves data from an InterMapper  
server and saves it for use by external programs. </p>
        <p>Although the InterMapper Reports UI is the easiest way to get data from the database, you can connect to the InterMapper Reports Server database using your own techniques. Several short example reports in Crystal Reports and OpenRPT are available, 
as well as several example perl scripts. The perl scripts require DBI 
and DBD::pg.
</p>
        <p>These scripts have been packaged and zipped and placed on our 
downloads server, and are available at:</p>

        <p>Please feel 
free to share your own, as well.</p>
        <p>If you want to create your own queries to retrieve data, see <a href="Creating_SQL_Queries.htm">Creating SQL&#160;Queries<MadCap:xref href="Creating_SQL_Queries.htm" target="" title="" alt=""> (Pg 1)</MadCap:xref></a>.</p>
