            <MadCap:keyword term="Custom Probes" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Probes" />Overview</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="LDAP" />For many Internet services, simply "pinging" a device is not a sufficient test of whether it is operating correctly. InterMapper has a number of built-in probes that can test different aspects of a device's operation, whether it's a web server, router, database, LDAP server etc. </p>
        <p>However, InterMapper's built-in probes may not test the kinds of devices you want to monitor, or may not test them ways that are most useful to you. In such a case, you can create your own probes. InterMapper's probes are defined by <i>probe files</i>, simple text files that can be duplicated and modified using any standard text editing utility. When you create your own probe, it becomes a first-class citizen and appears in the                    Set Probe window along with the built-in probes.</p>
        <h2>What is a probe?</h2>
        <p>A probe is a text file that specifies the way in which InterMapper tests a device. It is essentially a plug-in. All of InterMapper's probes follow the same logic:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="SNMP" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="TCP" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="UDP" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Sending:SNMP" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="AppleTalk datagrams" />The probe sends one or more queries, as SNMP requests or UDP datagrams or over a TCP connection to the device being tested.
</li>
            <li> The device responds (or fails to respond).
</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="DOWN" />If there is no response, InterMapper sets the device's status to DOWN.
</li>
            <li> InterMapper examines the response(s) from the device, and sets the device's status accordingly.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Parts of a Probe</h2>
        <p>All of the probe types listed below follow a similar structure. This is outlined in <a href="Anatomy_of_a_Probe.htm">Anatomy of A Probe<MadCap:xref href="Anatomy_of_a_Probe.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print"> (Pg 1)</MadCap:xref></a>, which explains the common sections of a probe, and the sections that are specific to a particular probe type.</p>
        <h2>Types of Probes</h2>
        <p>InterMapper has several kinds of probes. You can use InterMapper's built-in probes as-is, you can copy and modify them, or you can develop your own probes from scratch. These are the different probe types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="customsnmpprobes.html"><b>SNMP Probes</b><MadCap:xref href="customsnmpprobes.html" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print" style="font-weight: bold;"> (Pg 1)</MadCap:xref></a> <![CDATA[ ]]><MadCap:keyword term="Sending" /> - InterMapper tests the device's status by sending SNMP queries and comparing the results to 
	user-specified thresholds. </li>
            <li><a href="handlingtraps.htm"><b>SNMP Trap Probes</b><MadCap:xref href="handlingtraps.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print" style="font-weight: bold;"> (Pg 1)</MadCap:xref></a> - InterMapper can receive and process SNMP traps, and can set the status of a probe based on the contents of the trap's variables. You can create custom probes that alert you to problems in a certain device based on the contents of specific trap variables.<br /></li>
            <li><a href="TCP_Probes.htm"><b>TCP Probes</b><MadCap:xref href="TCP_Probes.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print" style="font-weight: bold;"> (Pg 1)</MadCap:xref></a> - InterMapper establishes a TCP connection to a device. It then sends certain requests and evaluates the 	
	responses to determine the device's status. 
	TCP probes uses the <a href="language.html">TCP Probe Scripting language<MadCap:xref href="language.html" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print" style="font-weight: normal;"> (Pg 1)</MadCap:xref></a> to create a sequence of commands, branching to different parts of the script under specified conditions.<br /></li>
            <li><a href="commandlineprobes.htm"><b>Command-line Probes</b><MadCap:xref href="commandlineprobes.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print" style="font-weight: bold;"> (Pg 1)</MadCap:xref></a> - InterMapper can invoke a program or script (as if "from the command line"), and use the results to 
	determine the device's status.
	</li>
            <li><b>Big Brother Probes</b> - Big Brother™ is an open-source network monitoring program. InterMapper listens for reports from 
	Big Brother clients and sets the device's status accordingly.
	</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's fairly straightforward to modify the existing files to produce new probes. If you make a new probe file that might be useful, please consider sending it to us. See <a href="Sharing_Custom_Probes.htm">Sharing Probes<MadCap:xref href="Sharing_Custom_Probes.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print"> (Pg 1)</MadCap:xref></a> for more information.</p>
