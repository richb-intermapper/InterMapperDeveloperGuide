            <p>A <i>directive</i> is a special command interpreted by the web server 
 to control the way a page is formatted.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Directives must start with a "#" in the first column.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Summary of Directives</h2>
            <p>InterMapper has several directives that can change the way pages are formatted. 
 They are defined below:</p>
            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="caption-side: top;width: 5in;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;">
                <col style="width: 131px;" />
                <col style="width: 398px;" />
                <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><b>#template</b>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p><span class="code"><a name="kanchor739"></a><a name="kanchor740"></a>#template "othertemplate.html"</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>A target file may specify a template file with the <span class="code">#template</span> directive. The <span class="code"> #template</span><a name="kanchor741"></a> 
        directive is optional; if none is present, InterMapper uses the file named 
 !template.html as the page's template.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><b>#title</b>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p><span class="code"><a name="kanchor742"></a>#title "This is a Test Page"</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>The text in quotes becomes the title of the page - it enclosed in &lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt; 
 tags in the generated page. The <span class="code">#title</span> 
        directive also provides a destination for quoted links on other pages. 
      </p>
                        <p>Every target file must have a <span class="code">#title</span> directive 
 to give it a name. </p>
                        <p>You may include a macro within the quoted text of this directive. This 
 is useful for inserting the device name or other information into the 
 title of the web page.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><b><a name="kanchor743"></a>#alt_title</b>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p><span class="code">#alt_title "Test Page"</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>The optional <span class="code">#alt_title</span> directive provides 
 a way to give a page an alternate name that can be used with a quoted 
 link.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><b>#filename</b>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p><span class="code">#filename "otherpage.html"</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>The optional <span class="code">#filename</span> directive causes InterMapper 
 to treat the file as if named with the quoted string. </p>
                        <p><a name="kanchor744"></a>For example, a target file named "xindex.html" could have a <span class="code">#filename 
 "!index.html"</span> This causes the target file to be used in place of 
 the file named "!index.html" if its version number is higher. This can 
 be useful for debugging as well as experimenting with alternate pages.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><b>#version</b>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p><span class="code">#version "2.1"</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>The optional <span class="code">#version</span> 
        directive determines which file is used when there are two or more instances 
 of the same filename (as a result of using <span class="code">#filename</span> directives.) </p>
                        <p> The optional <span class="code">#version</span> 
        directive is used to break "ties" between several files having 
 the same name to determine which should be used. This comes into play 
 in several cases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li value="1"> InterMapper has its own internal copy of the web template files, 
 which it uses to create the original set on disk.</li>
                            <li value="2"> If you edit one of the default web template files, you could can 
 change its #version to make it take precedence over InterMapper's built-in 
 copy.<br /></li>
                            <li value="3"> If you edit the file without changing the <span class="code">#version</span><a name="kanchor745"></a>, 
 its date-last-modified value is later, causing it to take precedence 
 over InterMapper's built-in copy.<br /></li>
                            <li value="4">If you install a new version of InterMapper with updated web files, 
 the <span class="code">#version</span> value is 
 incremented, causing the built-in copy to take precedence over the user-edited 
 files,<br /><br /><b>Note: </b> The user files are not overwritten.<br /></li>
                            <li value="5">Through the use of the <span class="code">#filename</span> 
          directive, it is possible to have two files on-disk that have "essentially" 
 the same name. One<br />could be named "foo.html", and the other (named something 
 else) can use the <span class="code">#filename</span> 
          directive to set its "virtual filename" to "foo.html". 
 In such a case, the <span class="code">#version</span> 
          is used to determine which file takes precedence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p />
                        <p><a name="kanchor746"></a>Version numbers must be in a 'digit.digit' format. InterMapper uses the 
 file with the highest version number. This is useful for debugging as 
 well as experimenting with alternate pages. </p>
                        <p>If <span class="code">#version</span> directive is not present in the 
 file, the default version, "1.0" is used.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td valign="top"><b>#redirect</b>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p><span class="code">#redirect "otherpage.html"</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <span class="code">#redirect</span> directive causes the InterMapper 
 to find <span class="code">otherpage.html</span> and use that in place 
 of the orignal target file. </p>
                        <p>This can be used to force a well-known page (such as !index.html) to 
 display a user-selected page.</p>
                        <p><b>Note:</b><a name="kanchor747"></a> This directive creates a static redirection that works 
 only for web pages that exist on the disk when the web server is started. 
 To redirect to web pages that are generated dynamically by InterMapper 
 (such as map web pages), use the HTML refresh meta tag instead.</p>

                <tr>

                    </td>

                        </p>
                        <p>The <span class="code">#target</span> directive forces a page to be 
 opened in a new window named "window_name". </p>
                        <p><a name="kanchor749"></a>When generating the web page, InterMapper generates an HREF link with 
 a ...target = "window_name" ... reference. This causes the detailed information 
 to appear in a separate window when the user clicks a map's device or 
 link.</p>
